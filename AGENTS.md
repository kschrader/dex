```
src/
├── index.ts           # Entry: routes to CLI or MCP
├── types.ts           # Zod schemas
├── core/              # Storage + TaskService
├── tools/             # MCP tool handlers
├── mcp/server.ts      # MCP server
└── cli/commands.ts    # CLI handlers
```

## Storage
One file per task: `.dex/tasks/{id}.json`

## Task Management
Use `dex` skill to coordinate complex work. Create tickets with full context (like GitHub Issues), break down into subtasks, complete with detailed results (like PR descriptions). See `skills/dex/SKILL.md`.
