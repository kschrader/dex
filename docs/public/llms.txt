# Dex - Task Tracking for AI Agents

Dex is a lightweight task management tool designed for AI agents. It provides persistent memory across sessions, enabling agents to track progress on complex multi-step implementations.

2. Add skills to your agent:

   # pnpm
   pnpx skills add dcramer/dex

   # bun
   bunx skills add dcramer/dex
   ```
