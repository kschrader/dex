  "context": "The show command and others need better terminal display:\n\n1. show command:\n   - Context and result can be very long (multi-paragraph)\n   - Should wrap text at terminal width\n   - Consider collapsible sections or truncation with 'show --full'\n   - Better visual separation between fields\n\n2. Other commands to audit:\n   - list: Is tree view readable with long descriptions?\n   - help: Is it well-formatted?\n   - create/complete output: Is it clear and concise?\n\n3. General improvements:\n   - Respect terminal width (process.stdout.columns)\n   - Word-wrap long text\n   - Use visual separators (blank lines, headers)\n   - Consider pager for very long output?",
