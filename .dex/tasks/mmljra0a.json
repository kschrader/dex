Add guidance on breaking down complex work\n5. Keep it concise - this is reference doc, not tutorial\n\nKey points to cover:\n- Use subtasks when work decomposes into 3+ discrete steps\n- Don't use subtasks for simple atomic tasks or just 1-2 items\n- Each task should be completable in one session\n- 3-7 subtasks per parent is usually right\n- Context should have clear completion criteria",
