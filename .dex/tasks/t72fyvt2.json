  "context": "Add parent_id to tasks for subtask hierarchy. Simpler than full dependency graph.\n\nBehavior:\n- Tasks can have a parent_id referencing another task\n- Parent can't complete until all children complete\n- List shows hierarchy (indented or tree view)\n- Optional: hierarchical IDs like beads (abc123.1, abc123.1.1)\n\nSkip for now:\n- Cross-task depends_on/blocked_by\n- 'ready' command (unblocked tasks)\n\nPrior art: github.com/steveyegge/beads (full graph model)",

  "result": "Implemented parent_id support: create/edit with --parent, tree view in list, subtask count in show, completion blocking, cascade delete. Updated types, task-service, CLI, and MCP tools.",
