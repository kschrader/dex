SUBTASKS (if this task has any):\n   - Show after main task details\n   - Use tree display similar to list\n   - Show status, ID, description (truncated)\n\nExample:\nParent: abc123 - Implement authentication\n\n[ ] def456 [p0]: Add login endpoint\n\nContext:\n  Implement POST /login endpoint...\n\nSubtasks (2 pending, 1 completed):\n├── [x] ghi789: Create login form (2h ago)\n├── [ ] jkl012: Add validation\n└── [ ] mno345: Write tests\n\nBe thoughtful about layout and readability.",
