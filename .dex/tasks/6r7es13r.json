  "context": "Problem: TaskService currently uses synchronous storage.read() and storage.write() calls. This works for FileStorage but breaks GitHubIssuesStorage which requires async operations.\n\nCurrent state:\n- StorageEngine interface has both sync (read/write) and async (readAsync/writeAsync) methods\n- FileStorage implements both\n- GitHubIssuesStorage only implements async (sync methods throw errors)\n- TaskService uses sync methods throughout\n\nSolution: Make TaskService methods async\n- Change all TaskService methods to async\n- Use storage.readAsync() and storage.writeAsync()\n- For sync storage engines (FileStorage), these just wrap sync calls\n- For async storage engines (GitHub), these work natively\n\nImpact:\n- CLI commands need to handle async (already doable with async functions)\n- MCP server handlers need to be async (already supported by MCP SDK)\n- Tests need to use async/await\n\nImplementation:\n1. Add async to all TaskService methods (create, update, delete, list, etc.)\n2. Replace storage.read() with await storage.readAsync()\n3. Replace storage.write() with await storage.writeAsync()\n4. Update CLI commands to be async\n5. Update MCP server handlers to be async\n6. Update tests to use async/await\n\nDone when:\n- All TaskService methods are async\n- GitHub storage works end-to-end\n- All tests pass\n- CLI and MCP server work with both file and GitHub storage",
