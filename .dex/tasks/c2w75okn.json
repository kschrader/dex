  "description": "Migrate storage to one file per task",
  "context": "Change storage format for git-friendliness:\n\nStructure:\n.dex/\n└── tasks/\n    ├── abc123.json\n    └── def456.json\n\nNO INDEX - just scan task files. For typical task counts (<100), this is fast.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Update storage.ts:\n   - read(): Scan .dex/tasks/*.json, parse each, return TaskStore\n   - write(task): Write single task to .dex/tasks/{id}.json\n   - delete(id): Remove .dex/tasks/{id}.json\n   - Add readTask(id) for single task lookup\n\n2. Task file format: Same as current Task schema (one task per file)\n\n3. Migration: On read, if old tasks.json exists, migrate to new format\n\n4. Update tests\n\nBenefits:\n- Create = new file (never conflicts)\n- Update = single file change  \n- Delete = remove file\n- No index to maintain or conflict\n- git diff shows exactly which tasks changed",
